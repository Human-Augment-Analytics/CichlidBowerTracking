# I'm considering replacing the forward function for the PyraT-CAiT Stage with this forward function.
# Will have to see if it makes a difference.

def forward(self, anchor: torch.Tensor, positive: torch.Tensor, negative: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:

    Passes the input triplet through the i-th Stage of a PyraT-CAiT model.

    Inputs:
        anchor: a batch of anchor images.
        positive: a batch of positive images (similar to the anchor images).
        negative: a batch of negative images (dissimilar from the anchor images).

    Returns:
        z_anchor: the embedded anchor batch.
        z_positive: the embedded positive batch.
        z_negative: the embedded negative batch.
