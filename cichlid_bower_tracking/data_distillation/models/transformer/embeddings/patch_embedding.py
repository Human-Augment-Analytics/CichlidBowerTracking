        Initializes an instance of the PatchEmbedding class.

        Inputs:
            embed_dim: essentially the number of output channels of the patch embedding comvolution.
            batch_size: the number of images per batch; defaults to 16 [deprecated: has no effect on output, soon to be removed].
            in_channels: the number of channels in each input image (1 of greyscale, 3 if RGB); defaults to 3.
            in_dim: the dimension of each input image; defaults to 256.
            patch_dim: essentially the kernel size of the patch embedding convolution.
            add_norm: a Boolean indicating whether or not the output patch embedding should be passed through a layer norm before reshaping; defaults to False.
