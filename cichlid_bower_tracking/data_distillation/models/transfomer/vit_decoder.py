        Initializes an instance of the ViTDecoder class.

            embed_dim: the embedding dimension of the input.
            n_heads: the number of heads to be used by each TransformerEncoder's Multi-Head Attention.
            transposer: a PyTorch module used in reverse patch embeddings; must be an instance of either the PatchTranspose or MiniPatchTranspose classes.
            n_decoders: the number of TransformerEncoders to include in the decoder stack (n_decoders - 1 if isinstance(transposer, MiniPatchTranspose), otherwise n_decoders); defaults to 8.
            p_dropout: the dropout probability parameter for each TransformerEncoder; defaults to 0.1. 
            mlp_ratio: indicates the size of the MLP's hidden layer relative to the embedding dimension in each TransformerEncoder; defaults to 4.0.
