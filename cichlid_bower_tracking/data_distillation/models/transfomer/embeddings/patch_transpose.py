        Initializes an instance of the PatchTranspose class.

        Inputs:
            embed_dim: essentially the number of channels in the input.
            batch_size: the number of embeddings in the input Tensor.
            n_patches: the value of the PatchEmbedding's npatches instance variable.
            out_channels: the number of channels in the reconstructed image (1 for greyscale, 3 for RGB); defaults to 3.
            out_dim: the dimension of the reconstructed image; defaults to 256.
            patch_dim: essentially the kernel size of the deconvolution.
