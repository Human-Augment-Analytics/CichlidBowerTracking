        '''
        Initializes an instance of the PerPixelAverage class. Uses the inputs to define an empty PyTorch Tensor to contain the sum of pixel values,
        and a counter to represent the number of bboxes that are included in the sum.

        Inputs:
            channels: an int representing the number of channels to be considered; for an RGB image, should be 3.
            width: an int representing a fixed width used in constructing the average image.
            height: an int representing a fixed height used in constructing the average image.
            dtype: a PyTorch datatype used in defining the sum Tensor; defaults to torch.int64, only change to another PyTorch integer type when less precision is required.

        Adds a PyTorch Tensor of shape (self.channel, self.height, self.width) to the current sum of bbox images. Also increments the image counter.

        Inputs:

        Computes the per-pixel average of the sum of bbox images by dividing the sum by the number of images added. Specifically, the averaged value of the pixel in channel
        c at coordinates (i, j) is given by p_{c, i, j} = (1 / counter) * SUM_{all bboxes}(p_{c, i, j}).

        Inputs: None
        
        Returns: A PyTorch Tensor of shape (self.channels, self.width, self.height) which contains the pixel values of the averaged bbox image.
